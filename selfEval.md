# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- I'm most proud of being able to work through and find a solution to all of the struggles I encountered. 
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
- Funtions cut down on the amount of manual work that would have to be coded for the same type of query (once you have a function for a purpose, you can apply it to every instance of that purpose that comes up with minimal input)
